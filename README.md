# FaceDetecion-
Program that recognize faces using a camera, the face must be registered using a photo, and must be stored in the same path of the file of the project.

This implementation was made in windows and testes in the same OS. But in MAC should work perfectly fine. 

In the list "known_face_names" you should input the tags of the people you want to be identified in the camera. The program display the names based on the pictures stored in the list.

YOU MUST HAVE OPEN CV INSTALLED IN ORDER TO WORK.
